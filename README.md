## HARDHAT FUND ME FRONTEND

This is a simple example of how the front-end for a blockchain backend would look like.

It is an illustration of how to connect your DAPP to a frontend that novice users can understand and interact with.

Run the following commands to start the application

```scripts
yarn install
yarn http-server
```

Feel free to use live-server if you are on vs-code.

Sorry about the interface though :smiley: I focused on functionality :smiley:

:notebook: Note-To-Self: Will update the interface in future

### Working with a local hardhat blockchain

If you chose to connect to a local hardhat network, be sure to start the node, copy one of the private keys and add it to metamask as a new account.

Remember that the hardhat network you run should be on the backend fund-me project since this is just a frontend and doesn't have hardhat installed.
