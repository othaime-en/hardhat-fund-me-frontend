## HARDHAT FUND ME FRONTEND

This is a simple example of how the front-end for a blockchain backend would look like.

It is an illustration of how to connect your DAPP to an frontend that novice users can understand and interact with.

Run the following commands to start the application

```scripts
yarn install
yarn http-server
```

Feel free to use live-server if you are on vs-code.

Sorry about the interface though :smiley: I focused on functionality :smiley:

:notebook: Note-To-Self: Will update the interface in future
